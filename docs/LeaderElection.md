# Leader Election Module


## Overview

One of the major components of [Raft Consensus](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) is the leader election between systems within the cluster. Leader election is the method by which the systems reach consensus.


## Design

Raft Consensus uses a single leader, many follower design, where a client interacts with the leader and the leader then replicates all of the events that occured on it to all of the follower nodes. All systems maintain both a state (leader, follower, candidate) and a term, which is a value that monotonically increases each time a leader election occurs. The term is essentially a period of time in which a leader is replicating it's logs, before a failure occurs on the leader and a new election is triggered. 

Leaders maintain consensus with the other followers within the cluster through a heartbeat protocol, in which the leader emits an empty request to each follower in the cluster. Each follower has a timeout period, between `150-300ms`, which is initialized on startup of each system, and is randomized between followers so as to avoid multiple systems attempting to requests votes during an election period at the same time. If a follower does not receive a heartbeat during the period, it changes it's state to candidate and requests votes from each system in the cluster.

A leader is elected when it receives the majority of votes during an election process, so:
```
  majority votes = floor(n / 2) + 1
```

Let's say we have 5 nodes, then for a follower to become leader on initial startup, it would need at least 3 votes.

In this doc, the focus will be on the `RequestVoteRPC`, which is the remote procedure call used to request votes from other systems during an election phase.

The general layout of the request is:
```proto
message RequestVote {
  int64 CurrentTerm = 1;
  string CandidateId = 2;
  int64 LastLogIndex = 3;
  int64 LastLogTerm = 4;
}
```

1. CurrentTerm --> the latest observed term on the new candidate
2. CandidateId --> the unique identifier for the system requesting votes
3. LastLogIndex --> this is the index of the last log in the replicated log
4. LastLogTerm --> the term of that the last log occured in

## Algorithm

The basic algorithm is as follows:
```
Followers wait for an AppendEntryRPC during their timeout periods

if timeout period is exceeded on a follower:
  1. change state to candidate
  2. increase current term by 1
  3. vote for self
  4. broadcast RequestVoteRPC to other nodes in the cluster

  receiving nodes of the broadcast will:
    a. if term of request vote is less than that of the current term of the system, reject
    b. if the node has not voted for another node during the election, and candidate log index is at least up to date with the node's log, accept the vote and respond with vote granted

if request is received during period:
  reset timeout and wait for next period
```
