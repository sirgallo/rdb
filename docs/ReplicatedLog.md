# Replicated Log Module


## Overview

One of the major components of [Raft Consensus](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) is the replicated log shared between systems within the cluster. The replicated log helps maintain a log of all actions that have been performed on the state machine.


### Replicated Log

In this doc, the focus will be on the `AppendEntryRPC`, which is the remote procedure call used to request votes from other systems during an election phase.

The general layout of the request is:

```proto
message AppendEntry {
  int64 Term = 1;
  string LeaderId = 2;
  int64 PrevLogIndex = 3;
  int64 PrevLogTerm = 4;
  repeated LogEntry Entries = 5;
  int64 LeaderCommitIndex = 6;
}
```

1. Term --> the current term on the leader
2. LeaderId --> the unique identifier for the leader
3. PrevLogIndex --> the index of the log being appended for NextIndex
4. PrevLogTerm --> the term of the log being appended for NextIndex
5. Entries --> the entries since previous log index being applied
6. LeaderCommitIndex --> the index of the latest log applied to the state machine by the leader

The `LogEntry` message consists of:

```proto
message LogEntry {
  int64 Index = 1;
  int64 Term = 2;
  string Command = 3;
}
```

where the index is the index of the log, the term is the current term of the applied log, and the command is the command, encoded to string, that mutates the state machine. The command can be of struct type `T`, where it contains the necessary actions with a data payload to update the state machine.


### Heartbeat

When a leader is elected, it begins sending heartbeats to each node at a set inverval until a new command is entered from the client and a log is created. Any `AppendEntryRPC` can act as a heartbeat, but if no logs are available, the leader will send a heartbeat with no entries so follower nodes do not begin a new election.


## Algorithm

The basic algorithm is as follows:

```
Leader node in the cluster -->

  if no new logs are added to replicated log before heartbeat interval:
    broadcast heartbeat to all available nodes in the cluster:
      a. if success reply is received, maintain the node status as alive
      b. otherwise, label node as dead

    continue to next heartbeat or available log

  if new log is added to replicated log:
    for each system in the cluster:
      a. determine the next index that is to be applied to the system
      b. send an AppendEntryRPC to the node with the entries to be applied to it's replicated log
      c. if reply is failure and the term is higher from the reply, set the leader to follower
      d. set the follower next index to the latest index in the reply from the follower

    continue to next heartbeat or available log

Follower node in the cluster -->

  if request term is less than the current term of the system:
    return false with the term of the current system

  if the previous log being sent has index less than current log index of replicated log or the log at the index is not the term of the request:
    return false wit the current term and last log index

  otherwise:
    for each entry being applied in the request:
      if the index of the entry being applied is a different term than the current log:
        remove logs from the index forward
      
      append the new entry to the replicated log

    if the commit index of the leader is higher than the commit index of the current system:
      set the commit index of the current system to the minimum of the request commit index and the current commit index of the system

    return true with the current term and latest log index after appending the new logs
```
